Abstract 
The majority of people nowadays use social media regularly and it is clear that it has infiltrated our lives. Additionally, many people rely on social media to earn a living. Cyberbullying and vulgar language on social networking sites have become serious issues, particularly among Bengali language users. Natural language processing algorithms have a difficult time locating and identifying such problematic information due to the complexity of Bangla text data. This study provides a machine learning-based data-driven security solution for detecting and categorizing cyberbullying and toxic language for Bengali language users. We looked into and evaluated the effectiveness of several natural language processing (NLP) methods for spotting abusive language. We also provide an alternative strategy for tackling the Bangla-specific problems with current approaches. This research may enable networking sites and other online platform providers to provide web access that is secure for Bengali language users.
